An implementation of the excellent Godot tutorial series [Let's Build a 2D Platformer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc&list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ&index=9) by YouTuber [BornCG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdioEctcBLd2nw2aQkl8msw).

I thought it would be helpful to learn Godot in a language I was more familiar with, so I started following this tutorial series but did all the coding in C# instead of GDScript.  I decided to make the repository public in case it's helpful for anyone else.

## What this project is not:
* An original project
  * This is entirely based on [BornCG's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdioEctcBLd2nw2aQkl8msw) existing work, and I owe him an enormous debt of gratitude for creating the tutorial series and sharing it with the world.
* A shining example of C#/Godot best practices
  * I am still figuring out how best to use C# with Godot, so the style is all over the place, and the code could definitely be improved.
## What this project is:
* A reference for how to get some things working in C# / Godot 3.  
* An interesting comparison between C# and GDScript.
* A relatively faithful following of the original [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc&list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ&index=9)
  * Each video should correspond to a single commit in the repository which (more or less) represents the project state at the **end** of that video.  Feel free to jump around if you are working on a video and need specific help.
